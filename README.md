### Recommended software

  * These are generally not as good as the above

## Setup

Clone the repo  
`git clone https://github.com/Esri-Accelebrate/JavaScript`

Open a command prompt or terminal window  
Change directory to the **JavaScript** folder  
`cd JavaScript`

Install dependencies with `npm`  
`npm install`

Start the server  
`npm start`

If you are on Windows, you can start the server in another window  
`start npm start`

If running `npm start` does not open a browser window, navigate to http://localhost:4000/
to make sure the installation was successful.

## Before the class

There are likely to be changes right up to class time. The day before the class, 
execute the following commands in a terminal window in the **JavaScript** folder

```
git pull
npm install
npm start
```

If `git pull` gives you any trouble, delete the **JavaScript** directory and run 
through the commands in **Setup** above again.
